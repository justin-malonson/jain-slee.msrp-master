	<title>Introduction to &THIS.PLATFORM; JAIN SLEE &THIS.RA; Resource Adaptor</title>

	<para>This resource adaptor enables an application - developed using a Service Building Block hosted in a SLEE container - to send or receive data using the
    <indexterm><primary>MSRP</primary></indexterm>
    MSRP protocol (RFC 4975). For establishing sessions, one needs the assistance of a 'rendez-vous' protocol which -in this case- is
    <indexterm><primary>SIP</primary></indexterm>
    SIP. Thus, this RA has a direct dependency on the SIP resource adaptor and cannot be used without it.</para>
    <para>The adaptor effectively wraps the Java MSRP peer library so it can be ued in a SLEE environment.</para>
    <para>Currently,
    <indexterm><primary>nickname</primary></indexterm>
    nicknames are supported (draft-ietf-simple-chat), as well as message composition indication (RFC 3994).</para>
    <para>Secure sessions (msrps) are currently not supported, nor are Relay Extensions (RFC 4976)</para>
    <para>The activities are the created MSRP sessions that applications can use to send messages, nicknames, responses and receive events related to incoming MSRP traffic.</para>
    <para>Events represent incoming MSRP messages, reports and session status changes</para>
